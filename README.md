# Mask Detection Using YOLOv8

This project implements a real-time mask detection system that identifies individuals wearing or not wearing masks. If a person without a mask is detected, their picture is captured and saved in a designated folder. This solution is ideal for use in environments like hospitals, pharmacies or public spaces to ensure compliance with mask-wearing policies.

## Project Overview

- **Model**: YOLOv8
- **Task**: Detect mask-wearing individuals, save images of those without masks.
- **Application**: Useful for monitoring mask-wearing in public places.
